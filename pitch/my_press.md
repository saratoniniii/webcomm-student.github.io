
## Idea of the project
My goal in life is to work in fashion marketing, so I wanted to create a project that reflects that.  
For this reason, I chose the name **riflesso**.

This website is about an imaginary image consulting agency. Here you can book an appointment with the experts, but not just that, you can also find a section dedicated to advices and inspiration looks updated monthly.

This is the section where you can find our advices and pictures of some outfit that girls can take inspiration from when they don't know what to wear!  
I divided it in different section based on the occasion.
